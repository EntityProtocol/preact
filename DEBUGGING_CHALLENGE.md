Welcome to the DIRT Protocol Debugging Challenge!

The year is 2018, and you've just been received an exciting email: Jason Miller,
the creator of Preact, has invited you to join the project as a core contributor!
As of this morning you have commit access to the repo on Github, and you're
walking on air. Eager to get started, you do a `git pull` to fetch the latest
version of master while opening Github in your browser to review the latest
Issues. Then, your heart drops into your stomach. It appears that Hackerman, a
core contributor who was recently banned from the project for secretly
inserting malicious code, has sabotaged the project! Before losing his
commit access, he added a series of diabolical bugs to the code.

After the shock wears off, a look of resolve settles on your face. Hackerman may
be the most evil hacker on the planet, but he is no match for you, the greatest
open source developer in history. You roll up your sleeves and begin to
survey the damage:

1. Fork this repo and clone it.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Run `npm test`.

Your mission, if you choose to accept it: find the bugs and fix the failing
tests!

There are three bugs, each more difficult than the last. Fixing a bug and
running the tests again will reveal the next bug.

When you're finished, push your changes and open a PR against our repo.
